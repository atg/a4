0. A competent programmer should be able to learn the language in an hour. It should fit on one piece of A4 paper.
1. There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
2. Juxtaposition shall have no place in the grammar.
3. All conversions, except between Int and Real, shall be explicit.
4. Only pay for what you use.

6. Bliss is 80% functional, 20% imperative.
7. Turing completeness is overrated.

10. Cache is king.
11. No change is "small".
12. Consistency is better than aesthetics.
13. No surprises!
